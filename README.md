# rl_collision_detection

Reinforcement learning for collision detection using Deep Q Learning. Uses StableBaselines3 for RL algorithm training.

Completed Features:
- Custom environment: robot must navigate to opposite end of a room with randomly placed obstacles.
- Lidar type sensor to scan environment.
- Collision detection.

Work in progress features:
- SLAM: simultaneous localization and modeling.
  - Testing genetic algorithm using DEAP package to estimate robot's location based on the sensor measurements.
